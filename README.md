## My process

I started by building the HTML structure with a mobile-first approach.
For the layout, I used CSS Grid and grid-template-areas to easily manage card placement across tablet and desktop breakpoints.

Each card has its own style, with colors and spacing defined using CSS variables.
I added a hover effect using transform: scale(1.1) and transition to make interactions feel smoother.

Finally, I tested the layout on different devices and optimized images and text for better responsiveness.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Variables
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Advanced use of CSS Grid and grid-template-areas
- Building a Bento-style grid layout
- Responsive design using media queries
- Image handling with max-width and clamp() for fluid sizing

### Continued development

I'd like to refine my use of clamp() and responsive typography for better scalability across screen sizes.
